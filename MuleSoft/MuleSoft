What is Application Orchestration:
--------------------------
Application or service orchestration is the process of integrating two or more applications and/or services together to automate a 
process, or synchronize data in real-time. Often, point-to-point integration may be used as the path of least resistance.

However,point-to-point integration always leads to a complex tangle of application dependencies (often referred to as "spaghetti code")
that is very hard to manage, monitor and maintain. Application orchestration provides 
a) an approach to integration that decouples applications
from each other,
b) capabilities for message routing, security, transformation and reliability, and 
c) most importantly, a way to manage and monitor your integrations centrally.

What is Business Process Management (BPM)?
------------------------------------------
Business Process Management (or BPM) can simply be thought of as a system which automates business processes. Typically,
a BPM system has a graphical interface which allows you to model your business processes visually so that a business analyst or
other non-programmer can easily understand them and verify that they indeed reflect the reality of your business.
