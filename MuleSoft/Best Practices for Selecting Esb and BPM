BPM and ESB have different strengths. Consequently, the challenge becomes accurately determining system requirements and allocating 
the correct division of responsibilities within your chosen architecture. It is a common mistake that organizations choose either an 
ESB or a BPM solution without fully considering the nature of the problem they are trying to solve. While use cases vary, a good rule 
of thumb when selecting whether to utilize a BPM or an ESB solution is as follows:

BPM (only) Use Case:
If the use case in question involves very low transaction volumes, low performance requirements, and a high degree of human interaction 
in the business process and the system requirements are simple and not likely to change much over time, a BPM ‘only’ solution can be an
appropriate choice.

ESB (only) Use Case:
If the use case in question involves medium to high transaction volumes and architectural flexibility and scalability are also important 
due to the size or complexity of the implementation, then an ESB ‘only’ solution is the most appropriate choice.

BPM and ESB Use Case (together):
If the use case in question involves medium to high transaction volumes, architectural flexibility and scalability is required, and
a substantial portion of these transactions will involve human interaction in the business process, a combined BPM and ESB solution should be applied. In this case the BPM is responsible for the business process and human workflow interactions and executes on a high performing, flexible, scalable ESB as a complement to BPM.
